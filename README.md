## Project Description
During 2016-2018, Bitcoin "believers" keep publicizing the advantages and characteristics of Bitcoins, plus many investors successfully gained money in the Bitcoin market, Bitcoin has risen sharply. The world market began to frantically pursue the high price myth of bitcoin. This essay intends to use the market attention of Bitcoin to explain the increase of Bitcoin price.
## Research Motivation
The Economics Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman said, "Most investors are not standard financial investors but behavioral investors, and their behavior is not always rational"(Baidu Encyclopedia, academic research para, 4). In terms of legal currency, the value of a currency depends on the peoples' confidence. Bitcoin is circulating globally and without any government's endorsement. This makes Bitcoin less credible.  However, during 2016-2017, bitcoin prices have risen sharply to an incredible level.  From the perspective of finance and economics, such behaviors are already irrational.

From figure 1, significant fluctuations of Bitcoin began in 2013, from the initial $13.36/bitcoin in January 2013 to the higher of $1,124/bitcoin on November 29, 2013. Then, due to the public announcement issued by the five ministries and commissions of the People's Bank of China on December 5, 2013, state that Bitcoin "does not have monetary attributes such as legal and mandatory, and is not a real currency", "all financial and payment institution must not carry out the business related to Bitcoin", "strengthen the management of the bitcoin network" ("Notice on preventing Bitcoin risk", Yinfa [2013] No. 289), and the market immediately showed a wave of selling. On December 16 of the same year, China's central bank gathered more than a dozen third-party payment platforms to require them not to make any form of clearing and payment services for Bitcoin. The market has doubts and panic about the value and credibility of Bitcoin. As a result, another wave of selling reappeared, causing prices to fall sharply to around $530/bitcoin at the end of 2013. Until mid-2016, bitcoin prices continued to fluctuate around US$700/bitcoin.
After the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin began to rise sharply. Figure 2 shows that the dollar per bitcoin rose from about US$800/bitcoin in January to about $19,187/bitcoin on December 16, an about 2300% increase. If using the initial bitcoin price, the increase was more than 147,000%. This abnormal investment fever like the American gold rush in the 1850s,  caused some people to get rich overnight, some people went nothing. 
Therefore, this essay intends to use the market attention to link the price trend of Bitcoin, and try to explain why the Bitcoin price rose that sharply.

## Literature Reviews
### 1. The Origin and Rise of Bitcoin
The timing of Bitcoin emergence was very subtle. From 2008,, many countries economy were severely affected by global economic recession. The solution taken by central bank and government in various countries were nothing more than quantitative easing. These methods may be feasible in countries with strong currencies such as the US, but not in small countries.

A famous example was the Zimbabwean dollar from 2006 to 2009. Figure 3 shows that at that time, $1 USD could be exchanged for 1 trillion Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwean nationals directly abandoned Zimbabwe and chose to use US dollar for trading. It reflects that under the economic recession, people generally feel less confidence in government and central bank. In January 2009, Bitcoin officially introduced on the internet and firstly launched the open source Bitcoin client software. At that time, the market was generally facing economic panic, investment was extremely conservative, and almost no legal currency can gain market trust. Investors are looking for investment tools that can preserve their assets. It can be seen from figure 4 that the price of gold has risen sharply since 2009-2012, increase more than 100%, reflecting the market's efforts in asset value preservation and looking for other alternative hedge assets. However, at this time, bitcoin does not immediately gain market trust and recognition. The market needs time to adapt to a new currency and familiar with its operating principles. However, some investors who are dissatisfied with the government, legal currency, economic policies, etc. began to pay attention to virtual currency, and even began to win the favor of the first batch of "bitcoin believers." The initial bitcoin was only active in the trading activities of the black market and the dark network 8. The famous dark network trading site Silk Road used Bitcoin as a trading tool. According to the Library of Cornell University, as of 2012, Silk Road's average monthly trading volume exceeded $120, all using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. The transaction content and goods can be purchased in bitcoin from legal goods such as electronic products to illegal transactions such as drugs. It can be seen that while the real economy is halting or even retreating, Bitcoin is beginning to consolidate its trading position as an alternative currency. A famous example was the Zimbabwean dollar from 2006 to 2009. Figure 3 shows that at that time, $1 USD could be exchanged for 1 trillion Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwean nationals directly abandoned Zimbabwe and chose to use US dollar for trading. It reflects that under the economic recession, people generally feel less confidence in government and central bank. In January 2009, Bitcoin officially introduced on the internet and firstly launched the open source Bitcoin client software.

It can be seen from figure 4 that the price of gold has risen sharply since 2009-2012, increase more than 100%, reflecting the market's efforts in value preservation and looking for hedge assets. Some investors who are disappointed with the government began to pay attention to the Bitcoin, and even became the first batch of Bitcoin "believers". At first, Bitcoin only traded in the black market and the dark web. The famous dark web trading website "Silk Road", used Bitcoin as the only trading tool. According to the FBI's criminal complaint(as cited in Hern., 2013, para. 12), the average daily volume of Silk Road trades is 10,000 BTC, trading items include legal and illegal commodities and services.
It can be seen that the Bitcoin was developed while the economy fell to the recession.

 Figure 5 shows Bitcoin's trading volume in the 2006- Oct, 2007 on each Chinese exchange. The transaction mostly concentrated on Huobi, BTC China, OKCOIN, account for more than 90% of the total. Figure 6 shows Bitcoin's trading volume in different countries during 2006-Oct, 2017. The number of transactions in RMB was the largest, accounting for more than 90% of the total volume. It reflects that most of the transactions of Bitcoin in 2006-2017 were concentrated in the Chinese market. The investment boom of Bitcoin in Chinese market far exceeded to other countries.
From the trading volume of Bitcoin over these years, one can conclude that the main market for Bitcoin was China. Moreover, from the data perspective, trading volume was only concentrated in between mid-2015 to the mid-2016 which shows that Chinese investors were more likely to trade in the short term, rather than seeing Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Furthermore, the high price was greatly related to the large inflow of hot money during 2016-2017 which pushed up the market price. This did not change the intrinsic value of Bitcoin( Progress in Bitcoin technology).

## Methodology
In order to link the market attention and Bitcoin prices, this essay uses Google Trend: a statistical tool based on the search volume of netizens which using keywords as statistical objects and calculate the weighting of search frequency of various keywords in Google web search, to extract the search volume as an index used for regression. 
Used the search index to do a regress with the Bitcoin closing price, to see whether the search index has a correlation with the closing price. Moreover, this essay would provide another search index regression with the trading volume in order to test whether the search index has a correlation with the trading volume in USD.
This regression can give a brief explanation about how the market attention affected the price and trading volume.

## Data Selection
Firstly,because of the global characteristics of Bitcoin price, this essay chooses the Google Trend Index. The Bitcoin price uses the average price index of Bitcoin on major exchanges. The search index is the weighted average( from Google Trend) search volume for the keyword: Bitcoin.

Secondly, as 2016 was the first big increase in Bitcoin. The price also reaches its highest record of 19000/Bitcoin at the end of 2017. Therefore, the time period is selected from Jan 2016 to Dec 2017 in order to make the analysis in more similar and effective conditions.

<br/>
Table 1 shows the regression of Bitcoin price and search index. The p-value of the index is close to 0, indicating that the effect of index on price is very significant. Search index can be a good explanation for the price increase. Notice that the coefficient of search index is relatively lower than the coefficient of the intercept. Since the search index was a weighted average volume of searching keyword, this lower coefficient is not important to the result. If we change the weight of this keyword, the coefficient could be significantly improved.
