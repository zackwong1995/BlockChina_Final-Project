## Project Description
During 2016-2018, Bitcoin "believers" keep publicizing the advantages and characteristics of Bitcoins, plus many investors successfully gained money in the Bitcoin market, Bitcoin has risen sharply. The world market began to frantically pursue the high price myth of bitcoin. This essay intends to use the market attention of Bitcoin to explain the increase of Bitcoin price.
## Research Motivation
The Economics Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman said, "Most investors are not standard financial investors but behavioral investors, and their behavior is not always rational"(Baidu Encyclopedia, academic research para, 4). In terms of legal currency, the value of a currency depends on the peoples' confidence. Bitcoin is circulating globally and without any government's endorsement. This makes Bitcoin less credible.  However, during 2016-2017, bitcoin prices have risen sharply to an incredible level.  From the perspective of finance and economics, such behaviors are already irrational.
