## Project Description
During 2016-2018, Bitcoin "believers" keep publicizing the advantages and characteristics of Bitcoins, plus many investors successfully gained money in the Bitcoin market, Bitcoin has risen sharply. The world market began to frantically pursue the high price myth of bitcoin. This essay intends to use the market attention of Bitcoin to explain the increase of Bitcoin price.
## Research Motivation
The Economics Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman said, "Most investors are not standard financial investors but behavioral investors, and their behavior is not always rational"(Baidu Encyclopedia, academic research para, 4). In terms of legal currency, the value of a currency depends on the peoples' confidence. However, Bitcoin is circulating globally and most of the government does not recognize it. This makes Bitcoin less credible.  However, during 2016-2017, Bitcoin prices rose sharply to an incredible level.  From the perspective of finance and economics, such behaviors were already irrational.

Figure 1 shows the significant fluctuations of Bitcoin began in 2013, from the initial $13.36/Bitcoin in January 2013 to the higher of $1,124/Bitcoin on November 29, 2013. Then, due to the public announcement issued by the five Ministries and Commissions of the People's Bank of China on December 5, 2013, state that Bitcoin "does not have monetary attributes such as legal and mandatory, and is not a real currency", "all financial and payment institution must not carry out the business related to Bitcoin", "strengthen the management of the Bitcoin network" ("Notice on preventing Bitcoin risk", Yinfa [2013] No. 289), and triggered a ferocious sell-off. On December 16 of the same year, China's central bank gathered more than a dozen third-party payment platforms, require them not to make any form of clearing and payment services for Bitcoin. The market has doubts and panic about the value and credibility of Bitcoin. As a result, another sell-off reappeared, causing prices to fall sharply to around $530/Bitcoin at the end of 2013. Until mid-2016, Bitcoin prices continued to fluctuate around US$700/Bitcoin.
After the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin began to rise sharply. Figure 2 shows that the dollar per Bitcoin rose from about US$800/Bitcoin in January to about $19,187/Bitcoin on December 16, an about 2300% increase. If using the initial Bitcoin price, the increase was more than 147,000%. This abnormal investment boom just like the American gold rush in the 1850s,  caused some people to get rich overnight, some people went nothing. 
Therefore, this essay intends to use the market attention to link the price trend of Bitcoin, and try to explain why the Bitcoin price rose that sharply.

## Literature Reviews
### 1. The Origin and Rise of Bitcoin
The timing of Bitcoin emergence was very subtle. From 2008, many country's economies were severely affected by global economic recession. The solution taken by the central bank and government in various countries were nothing more than quantitative easing. These methods may be feasible in countries with strong currencies such as the US, but not in small countries.

 A famous example was the Zimbabwean dollar from 2006 to 2009. Figure 3 shows that at that time, $1 USD could be exchanged for 1 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, and Zimbabwean nationals directly abandoned Zimbabwe and chose to use the US dollar for trading. It reflects that under the economic recession, people generally feel less confidence in government and central bank. In January 2009, Bitcoin officially introduced on the internet and firstly launched the open source Bitcoin client software. At that time, the market was generally facing economic panic, investment was extremely conservative, and almost no legal currency can gain market trust. Investors are looking for investment tools that can preserve their assets. It can be seen from figure 4 that the price of gold has risen sharply since 2009-2012, increase more than 100%, reflecting the market's efforts in value preservation and looking for hedging tools. Some investors who are disappointed with the government began to pay attention to the Bitcoin, and even became the first batch of Bitcoin "believers". At first, Bitcoin only traded in the black market and used in the dark web. The famous dark web trading website "Silk Road", used Bitcoin as the only trading currency. According to the FBI's criminal complaint(as cited in Hern., 2013, para. 12), the average daily volume of Silk Road trades is 10,000 BTC, trading items include legal and illegal commodities and services.
It can be seen that the Bitcoin was developed while the economy fell to the recession.

Figure 5 shows Bitcoin's trading volume in the 2006- Oct 2007 on each Chinese exchange. The transaction mostly concentrated on Huobi, BTC China, OKCOIN, account for more than 90% of the total. Figure 6 shows Bitcoin's trading volume in different countries during 2006-Oct, 2017. The trading volume in Chinese RMB was the largest, accounting for more than 90% of the total volume.
From the trading volume of Bitcoin over these years, one can conclude that the Chinese market was one of the main markets. Moreover, from the data shown, trading volume was only concentrated in between mid-2015 to the mid-2016 which shows that most of the investors were more likely to trade in the short term, rather than seeing Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Furthermore, the high price was greatly related to the large inflow of hot money during 2016-2017 which pushed up the market price. However, this did not change the intrinsic value of Bitcoin( Progress in Bitcoin technology).

## Methodology
In order to link the market attention and Bitcoin prices, this essay uses Google Trend: a statistical tool based on the search volume of netizens which using keywords as statistical objects and calculate the weighting of search frequency of various keywords in Google web search, to extract the search volume as an index used for regression. 
Used the search index to do a regress with the Bitcoin closing price, to see whether the search index has a correlation with the closing price. 
This regression can give a brief explanation about how the market attention affected the price and trading volume.

## Data Selection
Firstly, because of the global characteristic of Bitcoin, this essay chooses the Google Trend Index. The Bitcoin price uses the average price index of Bitcoin on major exchanges. The search index is the weighted average( from Google Trend) search volume for the keyword: Bitcoin.

Secondly, as 2016 was the first big increase in Bitcoin. The price also reaches its highest record of about 19000/Bitcoin at the end of 2017. Therefore, the time period is selected from Jan 2016 to Dec 2017 in order to make the analysis in a more similar and effective condition.

Thirdly, the analysis is separated into three sub-periods. The first sub-period is from the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2016. The search index and price use weekly data during this period since Google Trend only provides weekly index data in the year 2016. The second and third sub-period is from January 2017 to June 2017 and July 2017 to December 2017, respectively. Both using daily data in search index and price during these periods.

<br/>
As can be seen from Figure 7, in June and December, the Bitcoin price increased while the search index increased. But during this period, the effect was not so strong. Since the Bitcoin price has greatly increased in 2017, the absolute value of search index during 2017 is relatively low to the price. Therefore, the search index during Jan 2017-June 2017 was adjusted( multiply by 10) in order to show a more clear trend shifts. And the index during July 2017- Dec 2017 was multiply by 100. Then from figure8, on March 2017 and May 2017, both search indices show the same direction with the price trend. The effect here seems stronger than during 2016. After that, figure 9 shows an almost completely same movement between the Bitcoin price trend and the adjusted search index. 

These figures show the move direction of these factors, but do not represent the correlation relationship between the index and price.


## Regression Analysis
### Sub-Period: Jan 2016- Dec 2016
Table 1 shows the regression of Bitcoin price and search index. The p-value of the index is close to 0, indicating that the effect of search index to price is significant. Search index can be a good explanation for the price increase. Notice that the coefficient of search index is relatively lower than the coefficient of the intercept. Since the search index is a weighted average volume of the searching keyword, this lower coefficient is not very important to the result. If we change the weight of this keyword, the coefficient could be improved.

### Sub-Period: Jan 2017- June 2017
In the regression results from January to June 2017, the p-value is very close to 0 and the x1 coefficient is 34.28615. Explain that for every 1 unit increase in the index, the price will rise by $34.28615. Since this index was a weighted average figure, the actual Bitcoin search volume is much larger than this value. Therefore, if the search volume is converted into an absolute value, the coefficient will show a more intuitive result. However, the result here can still conclude that the search index has a significant impact on the Bitcoin price.

### Sub-Period: July 2017- Dec 2017
From July 2017 to December 2017, the search index also has a significant impact on price. During this period, the price rose sharply and reaches its highest record. Therefore, the x1 coefficient during this period is also larger, about 227.

 ## Conclusion

From the linear regression of the three time periods, the result comes up with a simple relationship between Google search volume( representing the market attention of Bitcoin) and Bitcoin price. The results show that the search volume of the keyword: Bitcoin, is proportional to the Bitcoin price. Although linear regression only reflects correlation, one possible explanation is that as the market vigorously touted Bitcoin during 2016 to 2017, the rapid development of Bitcoin-related websites and ICO programs( Initial Coin Offering) led to the market exploded and increased investor's confidence, further led to the inflow of hot money. The positive correlation between market attention and Bitcoin price explain the increase in Bitcoin prices: mainly because of the inflow of hot money which caused by rising public attention. This kind of model cannot sustainable and will eventually burst at a critical point. In November 2017, Bitcoin began to fall sharply, from about $19000/Bitcoin in November 2017 to now about $5,000/bitcoin.
