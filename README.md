## Project Description
During 2016-2018, Bitcoin "believers" keep publicizing the advantages and characteristics of Bitcoins, plus many investors successfully gained money in the Bitcoin market, Bitcoin has risen sharply. The world market began to frantically pursue the high price myth of bitcoin. This essay intends to use the market attention of Bitcoin to explain the increase of Bitcoin price.
## Research Motivation
The Economics Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman said, "Most investors are not standard financial investors but behavioral investors, and their behavior is not always rational"(Baidu Encyclopedia, academic research para, 4). In terms of legal currency, the value of a currency depends on the peoples' confidence. Bitcoin is circulating globally and without any government's endorsement. This makes Bitcoin less credible.  However, during 2016-2017, bitcoin prices have risen sharply to an incredible level.  From the perspective of finance and economics, such behaviors are already irrational.

From figure 1, significant fluctuations of Bitcoin began in 2013, from the initial $13.36/bitcoin in January 2013 to the higher of $1,124/bitcoin on November 29, 2013. Then, due to the public announcement issued by the five ministries and commissions of the People's Bank of China on December 5, 2013, state that Bitcoin "does not have monetary attributes such as legal and mandatory, and is not a real currency", "all financial and payment institution must not carry out the business related to Bitcoin", "strengthen the management of the bitcoin network" ("Notice on preventing Bitcoin risk", Yinfa [2013] No. 289), and the market immediately showed a wave of selling. On December 16 of the same year, China's central bank gathered more than a dozen third-party payment platforms to require them not to make any form of clearing and payment services for Bitcoin. The market has doubts and panic about the value and credibility of Bitcoin. As a result, another wave of selling reappeared, causing prices to fall sharply to around $530/bitcoin at the end of 2013. Until mid-2016, bitcoin prices continued to fluctuate around US$700/bitcoin.After the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin began to rise sharply. Figure 2 shows that the dollar per bitcoin rose from about US$800/bitcoin in January to about $19,187/bitcoin on December 16, an about 2300% increase. If using the initial bitcoin price, the increase was more than 147,000%. This abnormal investment fever like the American gold rush in the 1850s,  caused some people to get rich overnight, some people went nothing. 
Therefore, this essay intends to use the market attention to link the price trend of Bitcoin, and try to explain why the Bitcoin price rose that sharply.
